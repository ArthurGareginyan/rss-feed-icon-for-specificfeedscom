Easily add the RSS feed icon by SpecificFeeds.com in any place of your website. It will be responsive and compatible with all major browsers. It will work with any theme!


== Description ==
An easy to use and lightweight WordPress plugin that lets you easily add RSS feed icon which connected to SpecificFeeds.com with the shortcode in any place of your website.

The plugin is based on the service [SpecificFeeds.com](http://www.specificfeeds.com). SpecificFeeds allows your visitors to receive messages from your Blog/RSS Feed by email. You can access all information (such as emails and statistics) about your subscribers if you connect your feed to a SpecificFeeds account. It's 100% free and also has several other benefits.

To use, enter your personal link from SpecificFeeds.com, choose icon and click "Save Changes". Then you can put shortcode [specificfeeds-icon] in needed place. It's that simple! If you want more options then tell me and I will be happy to add it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Q. Will this plugin work on my WordPress.COM website? =
A. Sorry, this plugin is available for use only on self-hosted (WordPress.org) websites.

= Q. Can I use this plugin on my language? =
A. Yes. But If your language is not available then you can make one. This plugin is ready for translation. The `.pot` file is included and placed in "`languages`" folder. Many of plugin users would be delighted if you shared your translation with the community. Just send the translation files (`*.po, *.mo`) to me at the arthurgareginyan@gmail.com and I will include the translation within the next plugin update.

= Q. Does this plugin require modification to the theme? =
A. Absolutely not. This plugin is added/configured entirely from the website's Admin section.

= Q. Does this require any knowledge of HTML or CSS? =
A. Absolutely not. This plugin can be configured with no knowledge of HTML or CSS, using a simple WordPress settings page.

= Q. It's not working. What could be wrong? =
A. As with every plugin, it's possible that things don't work. The most common reason for this is that the plugin has a conflict with another plugin you're using. It's impossible to tell what could be wrong exactly, but if you post a support request in the plugin's support forum on WordPress.org, I'd be happy to give it a look and try to help out. Please include as much information as possible, including a link to your website where the problem can be seen.
