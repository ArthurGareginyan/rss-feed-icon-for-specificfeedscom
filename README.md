![screenshot](https://github.com/ArthurGareginyan/rss-feed-icon-for-specificfeedscom/blob/master/assets/banner-772x250.png)

An easy to use, with intuitive interface, WordPress plugin that lets you easily add the RSS feed icon which connected to SpecificFeeds.com with the shortcode in any place of your website.

The plugin is based on the [SpecificFeeds.com](http://www.specificfeeds.com) service. The SpecificFeeds allows your visitors to receive messages from your Blog/RSS feed by email. You can access all information (such as emails and statistics) about your subscribers if you connect your feed to a SpecificFeeds account. It's 100% free and also has several other benefits.

To use, enter your personal link from the [SpecificFeeds.com](http://www.specificfeeds.com), then on the plugin settings page select the desired settings and click the "Save changes" button. Then you can put the [specificfeeds-icon] shortcode in any place on your website.

If you want more options, let us know and we will be happy to add them.
