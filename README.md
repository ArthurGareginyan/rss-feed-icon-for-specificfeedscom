An easy to use and lightweight WordPress plugin that lets you easily add RSS feed icon which connected to SpecificFeeds.com with the shortcode in any place of your website.

The plugin is based on the service [SpecificFeeds.com](http://www.specificfeeds.com). SpecificFeeds allows your visitors to receive messages from your Blog/RSS Feed by email. You can access all information (such as emails and statistics) about your subscribers if you connect your feed to a SpecificFeeds account. It's 100% free and also has several other benefits.

To use, enter your personal link from SpecificFeeds.com, choose icon and click "Save Changes". Then you can put shortcode [specificfeeds-icon] in needed place. It's that simple! If you want more options then tell me and I will be happy to add it.
